## Usage

To test it, you can simply run the jupyter notebook inserting a city name, state or country, and the date and time in the "YYYYMMDDH" format. The default reanalysis model is set to ERA5 but you can also change it to CFSR/CFSRv2. 

Note: ERA5 has hourly outputs while CFSR/CFSRv2 only at 00/06/12/18 UTC.
